# ECE-6913-MLCS

All the resources will downloaded and organized automatically when you run the code in colab, like clean and bad datasets and bad model.

The repaired models are in the /models repository and you can distinguish them from their names:
repair2.h5 X=2
repair5.h5 X=5
repair10.h5 X=10
repair30.h5 X=30
You can also generate the repaired models using the code.

The code is in the /code repository. It's .ipynb format and you can directly run in in the colab.(Maybe you will need colab pro since the ram of the program is high.)

The plot image can be found in the /plot repository. You can also plot it in the code.
